I have a basic test node proyect
It's a simple express server
I want to copmpile it in github actions
And upload it to AWS S3 bucket
trigger codebuld when S3 bucket is updated
then in codebuild make a docker image with node 22 image base from ECR
Then push it to ECR
then in codepipeline make a pipeline to deploy the docker image to EC2
